# MakeCode editor features

The MakeCode editor window has many features to help you create, download, and save your coding projects.

## Creating blocks and code

### Blocks Toolbox

The blocks you use in your project are found in the **Toolbox**. The Toolbox is a sidebar list of block categories for different code functions and operations. To get a block from the toolbox, you select a block category and a block shelf opens showing you the available blocks. You grab a block from the shelf and pull it onto the block workspace. There's also a search control to help you find the blocks your interested in.

### JavaScript editor

The JavaScript editor is a fully functional text editor that's code aware. This means that it can help complete functions and statements for you by providing hints and text completion. A detailed description of the JavaScript editor features is here:  https://makecode.com/js/editor.
